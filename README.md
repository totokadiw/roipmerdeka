ROIP MERDEKA

ROIP MERDEKA is a gathering place for communication activists based on ROIP (Radio Over Internet Protocol) who are also activists of KRAP (Komunikasi Radio Antar Penduduk). We aim to utilize ROIP technology as a bridge to break through the limitations of radio-based communication within the KRAP framework to unite Indonesia. Our use of ROIP technology is realized in the provision of Teamspeak 3 server facilities for KRAP activists as an alternative communication medium for disasters.

Our Motto:
"Breaking Boundaries, Uniting INDONESIA!"
